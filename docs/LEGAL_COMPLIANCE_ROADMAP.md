# NorChain Legal & Compliance Roadmap

> **MiCA-Safe Tokenization Strategy**
>
> "Private First — Regulated Later"

---

## Master Strategy

This roadmap enables tokenization of PureMinerals and NorVége **without triggering**:

- MiCA (EU Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation)
- Finanstilsynet (Norwegian Financial Supervisory Authority)
- Securities law violations
- Payment service regulations

### Core Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| NO public token sale | Private placement only |
| NO public trading | Whitelisted investors only |
| NO investor marketing | Invitation-only distribution |
| NO profit claims on NOR | Utility token separation |
| ALL equity tokens private | Security token classification |
| ALL payments via escrow | KYC-gated SmartPay system |

---

## Token Classification

**Critical distinction that enables regulatory safety:**

| Token | Classification | Tradability | Regulation |
|-------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| **NOR** | Utility Token | Public | Minimal |
| **PM-EQ** | Security Token | Private only | Private placement exempt |
| **NV-EQ** | Security Token | Private only | Private placement exempt |

### NOR Token (Utility)

- Network gas fees
- Platform access
- SmartPay transactions
- NO dividends
- NO profit sharing
- NO equity claims

### PM-EQ / NV-EQ Tokens (Security)

- Represents actual equity ownership
- Transfer-restricted
- KYC-gated
- Whitelist-only transfers
- Private secondary market only
- NOT publicly tradable

## Phase 2: Tokenization Architecture

| Transfer restrictions | Prevent public trading | Avoids exchange rules |
| KYC-gating | Verify all holders | Maintains private status |
| Whitelist-only | Control investor base | No public offering |
| Pause mechanism | Emergency compliance | Regulatory response |

### 2.2 Investor Registry Contract

| Data Stored | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Wallet → Legal identity | KYC linkage |
| KYC verification hash | Compliance proof |
| Share class (A/B) | Rights differentiation |
| Accreditation type | Investor qualification |
| Jurisdiction | Geographic compliance |
| Investment limits | Regulatory caps |

### 2.3 Certificate Registry

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| PDF certificate hashes | Legal proof of ownership |
| Timestamp records | Audit trail |
| Amendment history | Change tracking |
| Signature verification | Authenticity proof |

### 2.4 Distribution Vault

| Function | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Hold total supply | Single source of truth |
| Controlled distribution | Admin-only minting |
| Audit trail | Full transaction history |
| Multi-sig control | Governance requirement |

### MiCA Avoidance

- Token is NOT public
- Ownership is private, closed, KYC-only
- No public liquidity provided
- No exchange listings

---

## Phase 3: Existing Investors Migration

**Duration**: 2–4 weeks

**Goal**: Move current shareholders to tokenized equity safely.

### Migration Process

| Step | Action | Compliance |
|------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Cap table conversion | Legal documentation |
| 2 | Mint total PM-EQ supply | Matches existing shares |
| 3 | KYC all existing investors | Regulatory requirement |
| 4 | Airdrop PM-EQ to investors | Based on ownership |
| 5 | Issue token certificates | Legal proof |
| 6 | Lock transfers | Until platform launch |

### Legal Basis

| Factor | Why Safe |
|--------|----------|
| Not a public offering | Existing shareholders only |
| Not new fundraising | Structural modernization |
| Same ownership rights | Token represents existing shares |
| Documented consent | Shareholder approval |

### MiCA Avoidance

- No new capital raised
- No public offering
- Existing shareholders only
- Structural change, not fundraising

---

## Phase 4: Private Investor Portal

**Duration**: 4–6 weeks

**Goal**: Controlled environment for compliant investor interaction.

### Portal Features

| Feature | Compliance Purpose |
|---------|-------------------|
| KYC onboarding | Verify all investors |
| Investor dashboard | Transparent holdings |
| PM-EQ portfolio | Ownership visibility |
| Certificates | Legal documentation |
| Document vault | Required disclosures |
| Company updates | Governance communication |

### Private Secondary Market

| Rule | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| KYC-to-KYC only | Both parties verified |
| SmartPay escrow | Protected transactions |
| Compliance checks | Automatic verification |
| No public order book | Private matching only |
| Transfer restrictions | Whitelist enforcement |
| Cooling-off periods | Regulatory alignment |

### MiCA Avoidance

- No public trading
- No DEX/CEX listings
- All transfers require KYC
- Private market only

---

## Phase 5: SmartPay Escrow & NOR Payments

**Duration**: 5–7 weeks

**Goal**: Secure funding flows without payment service regulation.

### SmartPay Architecture

| Component | Function | Regulatory Status |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| NOR-only payments | PM-EQ purchases | Crypto-to-crypto |
| Escrow contract | Holds funds securely | Smart contract |
| KYC verification | Pre-issuance check | Compliance gate |
| Treasury release | After KYC approval | Controlled flow |
| Refund system | Automated returns | Consumer protection |

### Legal Safeguards

| Safeguard | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| No fiat handling | SmartPay is crypto-only |
| Partner compliance | On-ramp handles fiat |
| Company conversion | PureMinerals handles FIAT |
| Utility separation | NOR not tied to profits |

### Payment Flow

```
Investor → FIAT → On-ramp Partner (regulated) → NOR → SmartPay Escrow → PM-EQ
                                                              ↓
                                              KYC Verification Gate
                                                              ↓
                                              Treasury Release (after approval)
```

### Why This Is Safe

| Factor | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| No fiat custody | NorChain never holds fiat |
| Regulated partners | On-ramps are licensed |
| Crypto settlement | Outside payment regulations |
| Escrow protection | Smart contract, not custody |

---

## Phase 6: FIAT On-Ramp Integration

**Duration**: 3–6 weeks (optional)

**Goal**: Easy NOR purchase without VASP registration.

### Partner Responsibilities

| Partner | Handles |
|---------|---------|
| MoonPay / Ramp / Stripe | KYC verification |
| | AML screening |
| | Fraud prevention |
| | Card/bank compliance |
| | Regulatory reporting |

### Supported Payment Methods

| Method | Provider |
|--------|----------|
| Bank card | MoonPay/Ramp |
| Bank transfer | SEPA integration |
| VIPPS | Nordic payments |
| MobilePay | Nordic payments |

### MiCA Avoidance

- NorChain does NOT handle fiat
- VASP compliance delegated to licensed partners
- No money transmission
- No custody of fiat funds

---

## Phase 7: Coinbase Integration (Silent)

**Duration**: 0–4 weeks

**Goal**: Institutional credibility without regulatory obligations.

| Coinbase Prime | Custody option | No |
| Coinbase Market Data | Price feeds | No |

### MiCA Avoidance

- Not a regulated partnership
- API-level integration only
- No new obligations for NorChain
- Uses public Coinbase services

---

## Phase 8: MiCA Readiness Preparation

**Duration**: Mid-term (when scaling)

**Goal**: Prepare for future public offerings without changing current model.

### Compliance Add-ons

| Component | Purpose | When Needed |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Proof-of-funds logic | Source verification | Scaling to 1000+ investors |
| KYC reporting dashboard | Regulatory reporting | Public offering |
| Transaction audit trails | Compliance evidence | Exchange listing |

### Trigger Points

### Current Status
